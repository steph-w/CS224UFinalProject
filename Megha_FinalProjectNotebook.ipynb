    "### Overview\n",
    "##### Features\n",
    "The input to these functions is a list of features to train on. Ideally this is a list of dictionaries.\n",
    "We are using unigrams as our features, for which we have sparse vector representations for each sentence in the text. We are also using the dependency parses as a feature set. \n",
    "##### Binary Classification\n",
    "We are looking at binary tasks -- classifying as either male/ female\n",
    "##### Train and Test\n",
    "We need to split our data into two different sets -- one for training our classifier, and one for testing the model for accuracy.\n",
    "#### TO DO:\n",
    " - Add a function to read in the features as a tuple -- (dictionary, label) where dictionary is the dictionary for a sentence, and label is \"female\" or \"male\".\n",
    " - Account for the fact that a sentence could have both male and female labels\n",
    " - Add hyperparameter tuning for better results. Try out other classification models for better accuracy."
