SENTENCE: Upon enquiry , I found that Marraboo had been early in life _ fetish 00MALE00 _ , or high priest , to Damel , king of Cayor , a very powerful chief bordering upon the Senegal , and that 00MALE00 had artfully contrived to gain over to 00MALE00 interest a number of adherents , who , in process of time , became formidable , rebelled against their lawful sovereign , and took possession of that part of the country towards Cape Verd : to strengthen their position , Marraboo caused a wall to be erected , commencing from the sea shore , and extending towards the Cape ; which , in the estimation of the natives , and in consequence of 00MALE00 sacerdotal office , incantations , and charms , was rendered invulnerable : the hypocritical priest well knew the natural disposition of 00MALE00 countrymen , and the effect 00MALE00 exorcisms would produce upon their minds ; which operated so effectually , that when 00MALE00 army was beaten by the powerful Damel , they uniformly retired behind their exorcised heap of stones , which in a moment stopt their enemy 's career , and struck them with such dread , that they immediately retired to their country , leaving their impotent enemy in quiet possession of 00MALE00 usurped territory ; whom otherwise they might have annihilated with the greatest facility .

SENTENCE: There is also an immense animal of this species , which I have heard the natives of this part of the coast describe , often exceeding 30 feet in length , and of an enormous size ; it is variegated with spots , and the head is covered with scales ; the tongue is fleshy and forked , but its bite is not poisonous ; it is to be found in the recesses of caves and thickets , from whence it suddenly darts upon its victim , whether 00MALE00 or beast : it frequently chooses a tree , from which it reconnoitres the passing objects , supporting itself by the tail , which it twists round the trunk or branches : when it seizes animals , especially those of the larger kind , such as lions , tigers , & c. it dexterously , and almost instantaneously twists itself round their bodies in several folds , and by its powerful muscular force , breaks the bones , and bruises it in all its parts ; when this is done it covers the animal with a viscous cohesive saliva , by licking its body with its tongue , which facilitates the power of swallowing it entire ; this process is tedious , and it gradually sucks in the body , which , if large , renders it incapable of moving for some time , until it digests ; and this is the period which the hunters watch to destroy it : it makes a hissing noise like a serpent , and has recourse to a variety of expedients to conceal itself ; it is called by the natives _ Tinnui _ , and is what I apprehend naturalists term the species of _ Boa constrictor _ : it is most commonly found in the sultry climates of Africa , and I believe is also an inhabitant of Asia and America .
